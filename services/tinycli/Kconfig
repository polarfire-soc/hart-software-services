	int "Timeout for entering TinyCLI (in seconds)"
	default 5
        help
		The timeout for entering the TinyCLI (in seconds). When CONFIG_TINYCLI is enabled,
                the HSS will wait for a keypress for this timeout before continuing with its boot
                process.

                If a key press (other than ESC) is detected, the HSS will enter the TINYCLI mode,
                which allows interactive running of a small number of commands. Typing `HELP` at
                the TINYCLI prompt lists the supported commands.

config SERVICE_TINYCLI_REGISTER
        depends on SERVICE_TINYCLI
	bool "Register TinyCLI as a state machine"
	default n
	help
		This feature enables the TinyCLI command-line interpreter to be registered
		as a state machine, which makes it available at all times via the E51.

		If you select this, you will not be able to configure UART_SURRENDER, which
		allows the HSS to surrender use of MMUART0 post-boot.

		If you do not know what to do here, say N.

config SERVICE_TINYCLI_MONITOR
	depends on SERVICE_TINYCLI && SERVICE_TINYCLI_REGISTER
	bool "Enable periodic monitoring of memory"
	default n
	help
		This feature enables the creation of a number of monitor tasks which
                can be configured to dump the contents of blocks of memory to the E51 
                console periodically.

		If you do not know what to do here, say N.

config SERVICE_TINYCLI_ENABLE_PREBOOT_TIMEOUT
	bool "Apply timeout to TinyCLI prompt if entered before boot"
	default n
	help
		This feature will ensure that accidentally entering TinyCLI before boot-up
		permanently prevent booting.

		If you do not know what to do here, say N.
